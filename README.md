A modern, open-source local file sharing application built with Expo and React Native. Share files securely over your local network without internet connectivity.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Automatic Device Discovery** - Find nearby devices instantly using UDP multicast
- 🚀 **Fast Transfers** - Direct peer-to-peer transfers over your local network
- 🔒 **Secure** - HTTPS encryption for all file transfers
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** - Material Design 3 with liquid glass morphism
- 📱 **Cross-Platform** - iOS, Android, and Web support

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run on specific platform
npm run ios
npm run android
npm run web
```

### Building for Production

This app requires native modules and cannot run in Expo Go. You need to create a development build:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Create development build
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Create production build
eas build --profile production --platform all
```

## 📱 Usage

1. **Open the app** on two or more devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network
2. **Devices will appear automatically** in the discovery list
3. **Select a device** to send files to
4. **Choose files** from your device
5. **Send** and accept on the receiving device
6. **Transfer complete!**

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Settings

- **Device Name**: Customize how your device appears to others
- **Server Port**: Change the HTTP server port (default: 53317)
- **Auto Accept**: Automatically accept incoming file transfers
- **Save Directory**: Choose where received files are saved
- **Theme**: Light, Dark, or Auto (system)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
